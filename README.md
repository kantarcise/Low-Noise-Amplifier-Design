# Low Noise Amplifier Design
In EHB451E, we learned about Active Microwave Circuits; mostly amplifiers and oscilators.

This is a term project from EHB451E, where we designed a low noise amplifier and simulated &amp; compared to real world applications.

The pdf file contains the report. For curve fitting and data enrichment of S parameters, the small matlab script can be found here.
