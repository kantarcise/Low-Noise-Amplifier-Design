# Low Noise Amplifier Design
In EHB451E, we learned about Active Microwave Circuits; mostly amplifiers and oscilators.

This is a term project from EHB451E, where we designed a low noise amplifier and simulated &amp; compared to real world applications.

The [pdf file](https://github.com/kantarcise/Low-Noise-Amplifier-Design/blob/master/040130091-Term_Project.pdf) contains the report. For curve fitting and data enrichment of S parameters, the small matlab script can be found [here](https://github.com/kantarcise/Low-Noise-Amplifier-Design/blob/master/Enrich_data.m). General calculations for the gain and the noise figure can be made with the script [here](https://github.com/kantarcise/Low-Noise-Amplifier-Design/blob/master/Design%20Calculations.m).

Advanced Design System 2016 is used for simulation, and the transmission line parameters are iteratively calculated with the results.

It was a fun project =)
